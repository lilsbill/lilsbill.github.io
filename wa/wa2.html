    <h2>Hello! My name is Lily Lee</h2>
    <h3>I use she/her pronouns</h3>
    <p>I am a freshman majoring in CTD. I am from Colorado. My goal for this class is to learn how to build a website from scratch. I am taking this course for additions to my portfolio as well as the requirement for my major. I like calligraphy, I love to build and design and I am excited about where this class will take me in the future. I love to learn and I am exicted to build my website!</p>
